Before resorting to these alternatives, we strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution by going to our customer support. We will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution procedures, such as mediation or arbitration, as alternatives to litigation. Other than those matters listed in Section 2, you and Reality Smash agree to seek resolution of the dispute only through arbitration of that dispute in accordance with the terms of this Section 8, and not litigate any dispute in court. Arbitration means that the dispute will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury.

      8.2. Exclusions from Arbitration. YOU AND REALITY SMASH AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM FILED BY YOU OR BY REALITY SMASH IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT OR BY REALITY SMASH RELATED TO PROTECTION OF REALITY SMASH’S OR ANY REALITY SMASH LICENSOR’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 8.
    </h3>

    <h3>
      8.3. RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER WITHIN 30 DAYS. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN THIS SECTION 8, YOU MUST NOTIFY REALITY SMASH IN WRITING WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT.

    <h3>
      8.4. Class Action Waiver. ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A NAMED OR UNNAMED MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND REALITY SMASH SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO DO SO IN WRITING FOLLOWING INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATION.
    </h3>

    <h3>
      8.5. Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding; Selection of Arbitrator. If you or Reality Smash elect to resolve your dispute through arbitration, the party initiating the arbitration proceeding must initiate it with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The terms of this Section 8 will govern in the event they conflict with the arbitration rules identified below.
    </h3>

    <h3>
      8.6. Arbitration Procedures. Because the software and/or service provided to you by Reality Smash concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all disputes. However, applicable federal or state law may also apply to the substance of any disputes. For claims of less than $75,000, the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules shall apply; for claims over $75,000, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and relevant fee schedules for non-class action proceedings shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Further, if your claims do not exceed $75,000 and you provided notice to, and negotiated in good faith with, Reality Smash as described above, and if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator, in addition to any rights to recover the same under controlling state or federal law afforded to Reality Smash or you. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be binding and final, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement
    </h3>

    <h3>
      8.7. Location of Arbitration. You or Reality Smash may initiate arbitration in either Orange County, California or the county in which you reside. If you initiate arbitration in the county of your residence, Reality Smash may transfer the arbitration to Orange County, California provided that Reality Smash agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the change in location, as determined by the arbitrator.
    </h3>

    <h3>
      8.8. Severability. If any clause within this Section 8 (other than the Class Action Waiver clause of Section 4) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Section 8 and the remainder of this Section 8 will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver (Section 8.4) clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Section 8, except for this Section 8.8, will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court and IN THAT INSTANCE, YOU AND REALITY SMASH EACH WAIVE AND AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY, TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW.
    </h3>

    <h3>
      8.9. Survival. This Section 8 shall survive any termination of the Terms.

    <h3>
      9.6. No Waiver. The failure of Reality Smash to require or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of these Terms or the Privacy Policy or failure to exercise any right under them shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of Reality Smash’s right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance. The express waiver by Reality Smash of any provision, condition or requirement of these Terms or the Privacy Policy shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement. Except as expressly and specifically set forth in these Terms, no representations, statements, consents, waivers or other acts or omissions by Reality Smash shall be deemed a modification of these Terms nor legally binding, unless documented in physical writing, hand signed by you and a duly appointed officer of Reality Smash.
